<h1>
  8 Element DUal Band MIMO Antenna System for 5G Mobile Devices
</h1>
The 8 Dual-band MIMO(Multiple Input- Multiple Output) systems can cover in the ranges from (3Ghz to 5.0Ghz) due to this transmission of N77, N78 and N79 5G high transmission can be possible. In this Antenna, there are two resonant modes such as TM01 and TM10 which have values of 0.75λ and 1.0λ. We have figured out that the resonant frequencies between 0.5 λ and 1.0 λ can be excited and result in another new resonant frequency which is 0.75 λ which accelerates the 5G dual-band transmission in mobile phones. We can achieve a dual-band antenna using the coupling techniques for loop antennas with these modes. The dual-band MIMO system can achieve impeccable results in mobile phones which has led to the genesis of certain 5G transmission. The characteristics we calculated are antenna isolation, envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) and Chanel Capacity (CC). We have designed a MIMO model on Ansys HFSS Software with 8 antennas on two clearance areas of the substrate, which has 50-ohm microstrip lines as the feed which is parallel to the plane and the SMA Coaxial Cable Connector is perpendicular to the ground of the antenna connecting to the feed line and to the ground, due to this we can observe maximum radiation transmission in two resonance modes such as 0.75λ and 1λ which gives us a dual-band transmission for mobile phones and no Efficiency Degradation when the system is held by hand.


<h3>
  DIMENSIONS OF THE PROPOSED DUAL-BAND MIMO SYSTEM:
</h3>


	The dual-band 8 MIMO system can cover (3.3GHz to 5.0GHz) and has 8 antennas which are arranged along the edges of the mobile terminal. The dimension of the entire system substrate is 150mm×75mm× 0.8mm. The two clearance areas are (75mm×8mm). There are two small substrates which are on each side of the main substrate, these two small substrate’s dimensions are 134mm×6mm×0.8mm and have 4 antennas connected on each side. The 4 antennas are of two different coupled loop antennas which help for wideband transmission. The antenna strip height and width are 6mm and 1mm. The placement of the four antennas are is quite intricate where each antenna length is either 22mm or 21.5mm, the distance between the antennas Ant1 to Ant2, Ant2 to Ant3 and Ant 3 to Ant 4 are d12, d23 and d34. The Distance between the feed lines of each antenna is D12, D23 and D34. 
As seen at the outcome of the MIMO system, it has been proposed that if the length of the first antenna is kept at 22mm we have seen a massive increase in the antenna’s total efficiency as the frequency 3.3GHz increases from 36% to 65% when L varies from 21mm to 22mm.
