The 8 Dual-band MIMO(Multiple Input- Multiple Output) systems can cover in the ranges from (3Ghz to 5.0Ghz) due to this transmission of N77, N78 and N79 5G high transmission can be possible. In this Antenna, there are two resonant modes such as TM01 and TM10 which have values of 0.75λ and 1.0λ. We have figured out that the resonant frequencies between 0.5 λ and 1.0 λ can be excited and result in another new resonant frequency which is 0.75 λ which accelerates the 5G dual-band transmission in mobile phones. We can achieve a dual-band antenna using the coupling techniques for loop antennas with these modes. The dual-band MIMO system can achieve impeccable results in mobile phones which has led to the genesis of certain 5G transmission. The characteristics we calculated are antenna isolation, envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) and Chanel Capacity (CC). We have designed a MIMO model on Ansys HFSS Software with 8 antennas on two clearance areas of the substrate, which has 50-ohm microstrip lines as the feed which is parallel to the plane and the SMA Coaxial Cable Connector is perpendicular to the ground of the antenna connecting to the feed line and to the ground, due to this we can observe maximum radiation transmission in two resonance modes such as 0.75λ and 1λ which gives us a dual-band transmission for mobile phones and no Efficiency Degradation when the system is held by hand.
